An educational game designed for helping children study. 

Players can attempt to catch various Pokemon in a whack-a-mole type environment. Once a Pokemon is clicked,
or "caught," the player will be prompted with a question. If the question is correct, that Pokemon is added to 
the party. Once all Pokemon are captured, the player may move on to the next set of questions.
